Title: a Fast Implementation of Adaboost 
Description: This library implements a C++ based blazingly fast implementation
             of Adaboost, especially useful for large, in memory data sets. 
             The library uses decision trees as weak classifiers. Once the classifiers
             have been trained, they can be used to predict new data. 
             Currently, we support only binary classification tasks.
             The library implements the Adaboost.M1 algorithm and the real
             Adaboost(SAMME.R) algorithm.
